MEG/EEG Analysis with PSD, Statistical Tests, and Inter-Trial Coherence
This project implements an advanced analysis of MEG/EEG signals, including the computation of Power Spectrum Density (PSD), statistical tests such as t-tests and repeated-measures ANOVA, as well as inter-trial coherence (ITC).

Data Structure
The project uses MEG/EEG data organized as follows:

Raw Data: MEG/EEG files compatible with MNE.

JSON Metadata: Information about subjects, sessions, and experimental conditions.
